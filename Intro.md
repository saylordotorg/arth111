Course Syllabus for "ARTH111: Introduction to Western Art History: Proto-Renaissance to Contemporary Art"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this course, we will study important movements and some influential
artists in Western art history. We will begin with the
“Proto-Renaissance” in Italy in the 13<sup>th</sup> century and continue
through to the late 20<sup>th</sup> century. You will become acquainted
with certain regional and personal styles of art through this period, as
well as a number of renowned works of art and architecture. Art forms
and imagery are influenced by the surrounding world, the biography of
the artist who produced the artwork, and other circumstances of artistic
production. This course provides a framework for considering how and why
certain artistic movements emerged in certain places at certain times.
Some of the names and works we will look at might already be familiar to
you, while others will be new. The ultimate goal of this course is not
to provide data on individual works of art, although that is part of art
history, but to act as a sort of springboard. You will gain tools for
looking at and analyzing not only art by the visual world around you.
Please note we will make a number of sweeping generalizations regarding
styles to provide a broad foundational arc. Divisions between styles,
periods, and cultures are always fluid and selected examples could be
substituted with many others. The course design mirrors the scope and
content of similar courses available through traditional undergraduate
programs. We will move more or less chronologically, with some thematic
sections. In some cases, in-depth resources on specific works and
artists are assigned to suggest a broader range; in others, we will run
through a number of examples briefly. To begin, review a map of modern
Europe that you can compare with some historical maps we will look at.
As we proceed, look up terms and supplemental images. The following
