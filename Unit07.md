-   **Unit 7: Eighteenth-Century Art**  

    *While Baroque styles continued to dominate eighteenth century
    artwork in many places in Europe, an outgrowth known as Rococo
    lightened up the dark palettes and further exaggerated excessive
    detail and ornament in painting and architecture. In this unit, we
    will look at regional and cultural nuances of this development, and
    note the relationship between rococo styles and royal patronage
    across Europe. It is important to consider this style within its
    social-economic context: at the time, the rise of colonial economies
    was generating great wealth in Europe.*  
       
     *After the mid-century, a return to Classical form and subject
    matter accompanied the so-called “age of enlightenment,” when
    secular thinking began to challenge the entrenched Christian
    worldview of Europe. Art came to be seen as witness to and
    expressive of the American Revolution and the first overthrow of a
    sitting monarch in Europe with the French Revolution by the end of
    the century.  *
