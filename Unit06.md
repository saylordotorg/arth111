-   **Unit 6: The Seventeenth Century: Baroque Art**  

    *As the Counter Reformation picked up steam, grandiose renovations
    to St. Peter’s Basilica ensued. We will begin this unit by taking a
    look at these renovations and by taking note of the High Renaissance
    illusionism and aspects of Mannerism seen in Italian and Spanish
    Baroque painting around the same time. In this genre, artists
    employed dramatic lighting to emotional and theatrical effect,
    embedded messages of the Counter Reformation, and began to
    experiment with close-up realism—features that stood in contrast to
    the idealized harmonies and perspectival distance emphasized in
    Renaissance art.*  
       
     *In Holland, where Protestantism has taken firm hold, diverse, new
    genres emerged amidst a burgeoning art market. It is important to
    note that Flanders, a Spanish subject territory in the era and a
    high point in the wealth of European monarchies, remained Catholic.
    (Note: In France, government-sponsored exhibitions of art known as
    “salons,” began under Louis XIV; these salons become extensive in
    the next century, giving public exposure to many artists and
    eventually becoming a standard of conservative art tradition that
    “modern” artists will challenge.) *

        course, this can be considered the epitome of Catholic Baroque
        painting in content and style, climactic in illusionistic
        effects, drama, lighting, and detail. This is a culmination of
        Michelangelo’s conception and forms in the Sistine Ceiling
        frescoes, however unified into a mystical, rather than measured,
        space.

        Seventeenth-century architecture in England was classicizing and
        restrained. The main Baroque aspects are the rippling façade of
        Jones’s Banqueting House, creating by superimposed pilasters (or
        engaged columns) and the superimposed porticos (porches) on the
        Cathedral.
