-   **Unit 3: The Renaissance: Fifteenth Century Italian Art**  

    *In this unit, we will continue with the evolution of the
    Renaissance in Italy, starting with Florence, the epicenter of this
    revolution in art. Contemporary artists looked to the
    accomplishments of Roman art to express their own age, borrowing
    Classical forms for Christian subjects but also reviving
    mythological subjects, including nudes. Images of patrons integrated
    with saintly beings became prevalent in extravagant fresco cycles
    and altarpieces.*  
       
     *Artists as well as thinkers promoted art-making as an
    intellectual, rather than merely manual pursuit. Some artists were
    able to move away from guilds to have independent workshops. The
    emergence of linear perspective, realistic human anatomy, and
    naturalism generally became the new norm and spread to the rest of
    Europe. This dramatic artistic move towards an illusionistic
    representation of the world would influence Western art for
    centuries.*

        the most renowned architect of the era. We looked at the history
        of the Florence Cathedral (Duomo; Santa Maria del Fiori) earlier
        in this course. It was around 1420 that Brunelleschi began work
        on the dome, after another competition with Ghiberti. The main
        innovations in his work are the use of mathematically-derived
        modules and forms and geometry of Classical antiquity. For more

        Brunelleschi’s Dome website.
