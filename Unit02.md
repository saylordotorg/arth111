-   **Unit 2: The Early Renaissance Outside Italy - Fifteenth Century**
     

    *In this unit, we will look at stirrings of a Renaissance in
    Northern European (Dutch, Flemish, German regions), which remained
    tied to the ornamental style of earlier Northern Gothic through the
    14<sup>th</sup> century. By the early 15<sup>th</sup> century,
    influences from Italy and new sources of patronage promoted greater
    interest in naturalistic representations, which integrated with the
    elegance of earlier style became known as “International Gothic.” In
    urban centers, an emerging burgher or merchant class commissioned
    devotional images of sacred figures in recognizable, earthly
    surroundings. Importance was placed on minute details that conveyed
    both realistic observation and symbolic meanings. We will focus on
    “Netherlandish” painting (which loosely includes Flemish and Dutch);
    however, we will also look at a few stylistic developments elsewhere
    (beyond Italy) and the emergence of printmaking as an art form. *

    -   **Web Media: Perry-Castañeda Library Map Collection, “Europe
        during the 15th Century”**

        Instructions: Use the click/zoom tool to become familiar with
        the geography of Northern Europe. Flanders now corresponds
        roughly to modern Belgium. The “Brabant” encompasses modern
        Holland. “The Netherlands” and “Lowlands” are other common
        references to the combined region. In our period, some of this
        territory was an extension of the Kingdom of France under the
        Dukes of Burgundy, who were major art patrons.
