-   **Unit 8: Nineteenth Century**  

    *As you proceed through this unit, keep the two significant
    historical and social contexts in mind: first, Napoleon rose to
    power and crowned himself Emperor of the French Republic in 1804;
    second, European imperialism and colonialism throughout the world
    approached a climax.  (There would be three more revolutionary
    uprisings before monarchy was definitively dissolved in France.) *  
       
     *It is important to understand “Realism,” around mid-century, as a
    style with certain aims and tendencies beyond an objective
    translation of reality. In America, Realism was manifested in the
    art of the Civil War era. The Industrial Revolution, rail travel,
    and especially the advent of photography were impactful in the
    development of “modern art,” which was perhaps first recognized as
    such in the art of Manet and, soon after, the Impressionists.  By
    the end of the century, many artists, in different ways, were
    turning distinctly away from visual reality as the model for an
    “essence” of art.*
