-   **Unit 4: The Later Renaissance - Sixteenth Century Italian Art**  

    *During the 16<sup>th</sup> century, the trend towards
    multi-talented artists in Italy was climactic in the careers of
    Leonardo Da Vinci (1452-1519), Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564)
    and Rafaello (Raphael) Sanzio (1483-1520), whose works have come to
    define High Renaissance art. This unit will focus mainly on these
    artists. We will also see how the event of Martin Luther and the
    Reformation facilitated clerical commissions by the Catholic Church
    on a large scale. Rome was a major center of artistic activity and
    patronage in this period. We will also look at major artists in
    Venice. Please continue to supplement these readings and videos with
    a few high-quality, detailed images by searching for images discuss
    in this unit, and throughout the course, at the [Web Gallery
    Index.\*](http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/art/index.html)*

        Rotunda”](http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Villa_Capra.html)

         Instructions: Scroll down each webpage and read the text. Also,
        enlarge several views of these buildings by Palladio, who worked
        mainly in the Veneto. While the “Villa Capra, or Villa Rotunda”
        was created after mid-century, its plan epitomizes High
        Renaissance ideas of unity, symmetry, mathematic proportion, and
        interaction with light and environment. In viewing “San Giorgio
        Maggiore,” note the ornamental, less clarified use of classical
        elements, especially on the façade.
