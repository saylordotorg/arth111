-   **Unit 4: The Later Renaissance - Sixteenth Century Italian Art**  

    *During the 16<sup>th</sup> century, the trend towards
    multi-talented artists in Italy was climactic in the careers of
    Leonardo Da Vinci (1452-1519), Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564)
    and Rafaello (Raphael) Sanzio (1483-1520), whose works have come to
    define High Renaissance art. This unit will focus mainly on these
    artists. We will also see how the event of Martin Luther and the
    Reformation facilitated clerical commissions by the Catholic Church
    on a large scale. Rome was a major center of artistic activity and
    patronage in this period. We will also look at major artists in
    Venice. Please continue to supplement these readings and videos with
    a few high-quality, detailed images by searching for images discuss
    in this unit, and throughout the course, at the [Web Gallery
    Index.\*](http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/art/index.html)*

-   **4.2 Mannerism in Florence and Rome**  

    *Note: By the time Michelangelo painted the Last Judgment
    (1536-1541), he and other artists working primarily in Florence and
    Rome had moved away from the idealistic proportions and symmetry of
    the High Renaissance, a stylistic tendency later known as Mannerism*

    *Note: By the end of the fifteenth century, Venetian painters had
    become known for light and color, led by Giovanni Bellini, as
    opposed to geometric structure and drawing (or design) on the
    peninsula. The transition to Mannerism was generally later than in
    the south.*

## Unit 5: Sixteenth Century Outside Italy
 
*The most impactful socio-political development in the 16<sup>th</sup> century in Europe was probably Martin Luther's religious revolution against the Catholic Church, dating from 1517, that established Protestantism in Northern areas. As we shall see, this facilitated new ways of representing religious and moralistic subjects in the region. We will look at shifts in architectural style in France and Spain, as well as the Mannerist painter known as El Greco, who worked in Spain.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**

Completing this unit should take you approximately 2.5 hours.

* Subunit 5.1: 1 hour
* Subunit 5.2: 1 hour
* Subunit 5.3: 0.5 hour

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**

Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:

* Explain main ideas of the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation.
* Describe basic formal distinctions between Italian and Northern European painting of the High Renaissance.

Instructions: On each webpage, click various views provided for each building. If possible, try to have windows open for both webpages to toggle back and forth between the images for each building. The point here is a comparison of two royal residences in France, one early in the sixteenth century and one after mid-century; both were royal residences. The earlier Chateau de Chambord retains some ornamental aspects of regional Gothic, while the large, clear spaces of the plan reflect Italian influence. Construction of The Louvre started in the mid-16<sup>th</sup> century; note how this building is more severely geometric and related to the palazzo style that we have studied.
