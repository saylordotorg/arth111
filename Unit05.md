## Unit 5: Sixteenth Century Outside Italy
 
*The most impactful socio-political development in the 16<sup>th</sup> century in Europe was probably Martin Luther's religious revolution against the Catholic Church, dating from 1517, that established Protestantism in Northern areas. As we shall see, this facilitated new ways of representing religious and moralistic subjects in the region. We will look at shifts in architectural style in France and Spain, as well as the Mannerist painter known as El Greco, who worked in Spain.*

**Web Media: Great Buildings: “Chateau de Chambord” and “The Louvre”**

Links: Great Buildings: <a href="http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Chateau_de_Chambord.html" target="_blank">"Chateau de Chambord"</a> (HTML) and <a href="http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/The_Louvre.html" target="_blank">"The Louvre"</a> (HTML)

Instructions: On each webpage, click various views provided for each building. If possible, try to have windows open for both webpages to toggle back and forth between the images for each building. The point here is a comparison of two royal residences in France, one early in the sixteenth century and one after mid-century; both were royal residences. The earlier Chateau de Chambord retains some ornamental aspects of regional Gothic, while the large, clear spaces of the plan reflect Italian influence. Construction of The Louvre started in the mid-16<sup>th</sup> century; note how this building is more severely geometric and related to the palazzo style that we have studied.
