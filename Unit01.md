-   **Unit 1: The Proto-Renaissance In Italy: 13th Century**  

    *The beginning of the period known as the Renaissance is generally
    dated to the thirteenth century in Italy. The style has its roots in
    Byzantine, Roman, and Early Christian art. Patronage developed
    beyond the aristocracy to include urban merchants and the clergy.
    The rising influence of the mendicant orders (isolated communities
    of monks and nuns) promoted a new spirituality and a program of
    commissions that told stories directly to mainly illiterate lay
    viewers. Their mission of preaching to the masses necessitated the
    building of new, larger churches. In addition to architectural
    developments, painters began to exhibit greater interest in nature,
    adjusting their techniques from schematic medieval style. The first
    step was to study the properties of light and volume in order to
    depict three-dimensional space.*  
     *             
     Through a look at the frescoes of Giotto, we will see examples of
    this new naturalism as well as expanded religious narratives based
    on situations and emotions of real contemporary life. Also in
    Giotto, as well as the Pisano family of sculptors, we see a new
    interest in pre-Christian, Classical art. We will also touch on
    distinctions in regional styles in painting, sculpture, and
    architecture throughout Italy influenced by various political and
    trade alliances. *

         Instructions: Watch this video, with speakers Dr. David Drogin
        and Dr. Beth Harris (approximately 14 minutes). As you listen to
        this video about the Pisano family of sculptors, use the pause
        function to note down any art terms you may be unfamiliar with
        to look up later. Look up a few better-illustrated details of
        this and other works by Pisano at: [Digital Imaging

         Instructions: Examine this image of the *St. Francis
        Altarpiece* by Berlinghieri. This is an example of the *maniera
        greca*, or the Greek style, in late Byzantine painting that was
        popular in Italy just at the time interest in earlier Classical
        art was increasing. Note the frontal rigidity. The format of the
        piece shows the narrative turn that altarpieces will take, with
        scenes from the saint’s life in film-strip fashion.

         Instructions: Listen carefully to this audio lecture as Dr.
        Beth Harris and Dr. Steven Zucker compare Cimabue's *Santa
        Trinita Madonna*, c. 1280, with Giotto's *Ognissanti Madonna*,
        c. 1310, both in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence. Listen to the
        audio clip (about 11 minutes).  This comparison shows the shift
        away from the stiff and flat *maniera greca* of the Cimabue to
        the more spatially situated Giotto, who initiates the
        “Florentine” Renaissance style.

        Duomo"”](http://www.italian-architecture.info/FL/FL-002.htm)
        (HTML)  
           
         Instructions: Scroll down to read the history of the cathedral
        at the heart of Florentine Renaissance culture; also, browse the
        images.  Note that the cathedral (as it stands today) was
        constructed in the late 13<sup>th</sup> century; however, the
        famous dome was added a century later with new technology and
        styles, so try to imagine the structure without that for now.
        The elongated style of northern Gothic never became popular in
        this area; rather the heavier feel and geometric façades
        survived from earlier styles and led to a full revival of
        Classical forms in architecture in the 1400s, including the
        dome. The octagonal plan of the famous baptistery that faces
        “The Duomo” was built at least a century earlier in a late
        Byzantine style.

        Instructions: Examine the Milan Cathedral and compare its more
        “spiky” ornamentation with the Duomo; building in this
        city-state was more heavily influenced by French Gothic.

        Instructions: Examine these two examples of civic,
        administrative buildings of the period. In Siena, a heavier
        style prevails, while the Venetian building is influenced by
        Islamic forms, introduced through trade and diplomatic exposure
        to the styles of the East.
