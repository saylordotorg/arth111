-   **Unit 9: The Twentieth Century to WWII**  

    *Early in the 20th century, “modernism” in art came to be closely
    associated with abstraction, although many styles remained grounded
    in figurative forms. As we proceed through this unit, consider the
    concurrent technological and social developments, such as the
    development of the automobile and airplane, the advent of the two
    world wars, the Communist Revolution in Russia, the height of
    European Imperialism in Africa, and the Great Depression. Note that
    a migration of artists and intellectuals from Europe took place as
    Hitler came to power. This migration shaped the course of American
    art and effected a shift of the center of the art world from Paris
    to New York.*
